# stoppers-carousel

Coding Evaluation Task

I structured this code in such a way that, if someone would want to build a whole webpage or website, it could be done efficiently, that is why I've tried to modularise everything.

One assumption that I made was that the carousel would be moving one card distance at a time.

Note: The carousel does change it's functionality with respect to the viewport width, but it would have to be rendered in the device with the respected width for the functionality to take effect. If you are going to change the viewport width through the dev tools the carousel will not move forward after a particular amount of strocks, I can add in event listner to perform this functionality if you like but people who will the use the website won't care about the dev tools, they would just want a responsively accurate website rendered on there device.
